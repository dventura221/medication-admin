#### - Gameplay centered around making choices when interacting with elements on the page. E.g. asking the patient for double identifiers; verying the correct medication, dose, route, time; and assessing for the right indication and result of the medication. ~~Points~~/Pass allotted to the correct choices. ~~Deductions for wrong choices.~~ Safe to assume wrong choices lead to automatic failure, as this simulation is meant to train on nursing standards of care.

#### - ~~Once simulation complete in Patient Room, change to different page for an evaluation of the game. Constructive critical review of game with, pointing out areas of improvement.~~ Incorporate retry of simulation.
