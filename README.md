#### - Gameplay centered around making choices when interacting with elements on the page. E.g. asking the patient for double identifiers; verying the correct medication, dose, route, time; and assessing for the right indication and result of the medication. Points/Pass allotted to the correct choices. Deductions for wrong choices. Same to assume wrong choices lead to automatic failure, as this simulation is meant to train on nursing standards of care.

#### - Once simulation complete in Patient Room, change to different page for an evaluation of the game. Constructive critical review of game with, pointing out areas of improvement. Incorporate retry of simulation.
